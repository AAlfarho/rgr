Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature. This\n * allows the creation of custom validation functions. For example:\n *\n *  var MyLink = React.createClass({\n *    propTypes: {\n *      // An optional string or URI prop named \"href\".\n *      href: function(props, propName, componentName) {\n *        var propValue = props[propName];\n *        if (propValue != null && typeof propValue !== 'string' &&\n *            !(propValue instanceof URI)) {\n *          return new Error(\n *            'Expected a string or an URI for ' + propName + ' in ' +\n *            componentName\n *          );\n *        }\n *      }\n *    },\n *    render: function() {...}\n *  });\n *\n * @internal\n */\n\nvar ANONYMOUS = '<<anonymous>>';\n\nvar ReactPropTypes = {\n  array: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('array'),\n  bool: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('boolean'),\n  func: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('function'),\n  number: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('number'),\n  object: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('object'),\n  string: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('string'),\n\n  any: createAnyTypeChecker(),\n  arrayOf: createArrayOfTypeChecker,\n  element: createElementTypeChecker(),\n  instanceOf: createInstanceTypeChecker,\n  node: createNodeChecker(),\n  objectOf: createObjectOfTypeChecker,\n  oneOf: createEnumTypeChecker,\n  oneOfType: createUnionTypeChecker,\n  shape: createShapeTypeChecker\n};\n\nfunction createChainableTypeChecker(validate) {\n  function checkType(isRequired, props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName) {\n    componentName = componentName || ANONYMOUS;\n    propFullName = propFullName || propName;\n    if (props[propName] == null) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      if (isRequired) {\n        return new Error('Required ' + locationName + ' `' + propFullName + '` was not specified in ' + ('`' + componentName + '`.'));\n      }\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return validate(props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName);\n    }\n  }\n\n  var chainedCheckType = checkType.bind(null, false);\n  chainedCheckType.isRequired = checkType.bind(null, true);\n\n  return chainedCheckType;\n}\n\nfunction createPrimitiveTypeChecker(expectedType) {\n  function validate(props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName) {\n    var propValue = props[propName];\n    var propType = getPropType(propValue);\n    if (propType !== expectedType) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      // `propValue` being instance of, say, date/regexp, pass the 'object'\n      // check, but we can offer a more precise error message here rather than\n      // 'of type `object`'.\n      var preciseType = getPreciseType(propValue);\n\n      return new Error('Invalid ' + locationName + ' `' + propFullName + '` of type ' + ('`' + preciseType + '` supplied to `' + componentName + '`, expected ') + ('`' + expectedType + '`.'));\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n  return createChainableTypeChecker(validate);\n}\n\nfunction createAnyTypeChecker() {\n  return createChainableTypeChecker(emptyFunction.thatReturns(null));\n}\n\nfunction createArrayOfTypeChecker(typeChecker) {\n  function validate(props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName) {\n    var propValue = props[propName];\n    if (!Array.isArray(propValue)) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      var propType = getPropType(propValue);\n      return new Error('Invalid ' + locationName + ' `' + propFullName + '` of type ' + ('`' + propType + '` supplied to `' + componentName + '`, expected an array.'));\n    }\n    for (var i = 0;

To do this, we use a common technique of applying\n * the `aria-hidden='true'` attribute to the non-Modal elements in the Modal `container`. This means that for\n * a Modal to be truly modal, it should have a `container` that is _outside_ your app's\n * React hierarchy (such as the default: document.body).\n */\n\nvar Modal = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Modal, _React$Component);\n\n  function Modal() {\n    var _ref;\n\n    var _temp, _this, _ret;\n\n    _classCallCheck(this, Modal);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    return _ret = (_temp = (_this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (_ref = Modal.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(Modal)).call.apply(_ref, [this].concat(args))), _this), _initialiseProps.call(_this), _temp), _possibleConstructorReturn(_this, _ret);\n  }\n\n  _createClass(Modal, [{\n    key: 'omitProps',\n    value: function omitProps(props, propTypes) {\n\n      var keys = Object.keys(props);\n      var newProps = {};\n      keys.map(function (prop) {\n        if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(propTypes, prop)) {\n          newProps[prop] = props[prop];\n        }\n      });\n\n      return newProps;\n    }\n  }, {\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var show = _props.show;\n      var container = _props.container;\n      var children = _props.children;\n      var Transition = _props.transition;\n      var backdrop = _props.backdrop;\n      var dialogTransitionTimeout = _props.dialogTransitionTimeout;\n      var className = _props.className;\n      var style = _props.style;\n      var onExit = _props.onExit;\n      var onExiting = _props.onExiting;\n      var onEnter = _props.onEnter;\n      var onEntering = _props.onEntering;\n      var onEntered = _props.onEntered;\n\n\n      var dialog = _react2.default.Children.only(children);\n      var filteredProps = this.omitProps(this.props, Modal.propTypes);\n\n      var mountModal = show || Transition && !this.state.exited;\n      if (!mountModal) {\n        return null;\n      }\n\n      var _dialog$props = dialog.props;\n      var role = _dialog$props.role;\n      var tabIndex = _dialog$props.tabIndex;\n\n\n      if (role === undefined || tabIndex === undefined) {\n        dialog = (0, _react.cloneElement)(dialog, {\n          role: role === undefined ?
